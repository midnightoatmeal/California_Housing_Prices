# California Housing Prices Prediction

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict housing prices in California 
based on various features such as the number of rooms, location, income levels, and other relevant attributes.
The model utilizes regression techniques to provide accurate price estimates, which can help buyers, sellers, 
and real estate professionals make informed decisions.
